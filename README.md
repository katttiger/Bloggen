# Bloggen
.NET-console application (C#) using lists to simulate a blog. This is an old project that is about to be updated. To date it has the ability to **add posts, remove posts, sort posts, search posts (linear and binary search) and close the application**. Improvements to be made:
- Unit tests
- Clean code

Possible additions in the future:
- Connect the application to database.
- Connect functions to endpoints in an API.
